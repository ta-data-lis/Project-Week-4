## Project Description
For this project, I chose to analyze an IMDB dataset with 1000 movies records from 2006 to 2016.
I picked this topic because there has been many discussion on whether online movies aggregator databases can affect a movie's revenue or not. Also, because I love movies.
Much has been stated about the relation between a movie genre and its gross box office so I went for 3 other relationships: rating vs revenue, rating vs votes and revenue vs votes.

## Hypotheses / Questions
The main questions are:
- Do higher ratings mean higher revenue?
- Do more votes mean higher rating?
- Are higher-grossing movies watchers more prone to vote?

## Dataset
I got my dataset from Kagle, here:

## Workflow
Long story short: I started with a 1000 records dataset and after some data cleaning I ended up with 756 records. After, I perform some exploratory data analysis to have a deeper knowledge of my data.
Next, I performed some statistical analysis in search for correlations. Finally, I did some visualizations and drew some conclusions.
